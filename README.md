##Hipchat 2.0 theme for Hipchat 3.0


When I upgraded to HipChat v3.0 I got fustrated because the new theme it's worse than the previous version. After looking at the Resources folder I relized that it's using plain CSS. I started to make some changes and came up with this CSS version that looks a similar to the Hipchat v2.0 theme.

##This is how to install:


Go to Finder,

Applications

Right Click on "HipChat"

"Show Package Contents"

Navigate to Contents/Resources

Backup CSS Files.

Copy CSS files over.

Restart HipChat 3.0
